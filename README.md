# Romanian-sub-dialect-identification---Machine-Learning

In this project I had to train a model on samples collected from the news domain and evaluate it on tweets. I built a model for a cross-genre binary classification by dialect task, in which a classification model is required to discriminate between the Moldavian (MD) and the Romanian (RO) dialects across different text genres (news versus tweets).
